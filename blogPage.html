                    Hello! My name is <strong><a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/upasana-paul-b81395199/">Upasana</a></strong>, and I am
                    thrilled to share my journey with you. I began
                    my professional career in the dynamic field of <strong>digital marketing</strong>, and now I am
                    venturing into the
                    world of web development as I pursue my studies at <strong><a href="https://humber.ca/">Humber
                            College</a></strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>My Digital Marketing Background</h3>
                <p>
                    My foray into digital marketing began a few years ago, driven by a passion for understanding
                    consumer behavior and a knack for creativity. I enjoyed crafting compelling content, strategizing
                    social media campaigns,
                    and analyzing data to drive business growth. Working in digital marketing allowed me to blend my
                    creative skills with analytical thinking, making each project a unique challenge.
                </p>

                <h3>Transitioning to Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As much as I enjoyed digital marketing, I found myself increasingly fascinated by the technical
                    aspects of the web. I wanted to understand the "how" behind the websites I was promoting and explore
                    the intricate world
                    of <strong><a href="#">coding and development</a></strong>. This curiosity led me to <strong>Humber
                        College</strong>,
                    where I am now
                    pursuing a diploma in web development.
                </p>

                <h3>Beyond the Professional Sphere: My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>When I am not immersed in coding or strategizing marketing campaigns, I indulge in a few hobbies that
                    bring me immense joy and balance.</p>
                <h4>Painting</h4>
                <p>
                    I have always found solace in painting. It is my way of expressing emotions and ideas that words
                    often fail to capture. The process of blending colors and creating something from a blank canvas is
                    therapeutic and
                    incredibly fulfilling. Whether itâ€™s a detailed landscape or an abstract splash of colors, painting
                    allows me to unwind and reconnect with my creative side.
                </p>

                <h4>Travel</h4>
                <p>Exploring new places, cultures, and cuisines is something I cherish deeply. Travel enriches my
                    perspective, inspires my creativity, and fuels my curiosity. Each destination offers new experiences
                    and memories</p>
